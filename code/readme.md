Contained in this file is the notebook file containing the model and its evaluation, as well as a dash app that is used for the visualization component of the project.

The Hotel Review data set itself can be found within the dash-app folder. The dash app reads it directly from the route, while the notebook must step into the dash-app folder to read in the data. If this code is tested with the provided environment, this shouldn't be an issue. However, if, say, the ntoebook file is executed elsewhere, you may need to edit that initial read .csv file call, as the file path will probably not match.

If there are any issues regarding executed any of this code, please shoot me an email at noah.sealy@dal.ca.
Thanks for the great term!
