# HotelReviewSentimentAnalysis
## Research project for Machine Learning w/ Big Data course at Dalhousie University.
### This project compares the performance of different models in the task of sentiment analysis for various Hotel Reviews in Europe.
### The data set was too large, so if you want to run any of the code, after cloning down locally you will have to unzip "code/dash-app.zip"!
### Included is also a conference style report I wrote which documents the development process as well as the results.
