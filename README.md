# HotelReviewSentimentAnalysis

## Project I made for my Machine Learning w/ Big Data course at Dalhousie University.
## As stated in write-up, this project compares the performance of different models in the task of sentiment analysis for various Hotel Reviews in Europe.
## The data set was too large, so if you want to run any of the code, after cloning down locally you will have to unzip "code/dash-app.zip"!
